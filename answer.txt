Offtop:
The documentation on the official website: https://doc.babylonjs.com/ does not available in Russian Federation. I should use VPN for this. The Internet speed decreases a little when I use VPN. I do not understand why this is happen. But it is not a problem. I just let you know. Maybe this information will be useful.

Okay. I understand that I cannot use NPM to install BJS for a while. I will go in another way that you descripted. I read on the page: https://doc.babylonjs.com/ this information:

> However, you will need to download the BabylonJS TypeScript definition file from https://preview.babylonjs.com/babylon.d.ts in order to compile your project. Save this  `babylon.d.ts`  file into your project folder and create an empty  `index.html`  like so:

I created the "babylon.d.ts" file and save it in the root folder where my "index.html" was created. It works for me. I will described my steps below because I do not want to forget this.

I try to compile my source files but I see this error:
> official-example-bjs-ts> tsc
> error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'babylonjs'.

"import" gives the same result:
`import * as BABYLON from "babylonjs";`

Game.ts

    ///<reference path="babylon.d.ts" />
    // import * as BABYLON from "babylonjs";

    export class Game
    {
        private _canvas: HTMLCanvasElement;
        private _engine: BABYLON.Engine;

        public constructor(canvasName: string)
        {
            // Create canvas and engine
            this._canvas = document.getElementById(canvasName) as HTMLCanvasElement;
            this._engine = new BABYLON.Engine(this._canvas, true);
        }
    }

Program.ts

    import { Game } from "./Game";

    class Program
    {
        public static Main()
        {
            let game = new Game("renderCanvas");
        }
    }

    window.onload = () =>
    {
        Program.Main();
    }
